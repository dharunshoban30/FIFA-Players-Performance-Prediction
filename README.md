# âš½ FIFA Player Performance Prediction Project - My First Ever Data Science Project

## Overview
The project aims to predict FIFA player performance metrics using machine learning models. The dataset used in this project `kl.csv` is downloaded from Kaggle. The goal is to apply various machine learning techniques to predict key player attributes, analyze the results, and provide insights into what influences player performance.

## Objective
The primary objectives of this project are to:
- Understand the factors influencing FIFA player performance.
- Apply data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis to the dataset.
- Implement and compare different machine learning models for player attribute prediction.
- Evaluate the performance of the models using appropriate metrics.
- Draw insights and make recommendations based on the analysis.
  
## Contents
This project is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook, which includes the following sections:

1. **Introduction:**
    - Overview of the FIFA player dataset and its importance.
    - Understanding player metrics and how they affect the overall game.

2. **Data Preparation:**
    - Loading and preprocessing the fifa_19_complete_player_dataset.csv dataset.
    - Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
  
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis:**
    - Visualization and analysis of key features and their relationships with player performance.

4. **Model Construction:**
Detailed step-by-step implementation of various machine learning models, including:
    - Linear Regression
    - Decision Trees
    - Random Forest

5. **Model Evaluation:**
    - Calculation and interpretation of key metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared.
    - Comparison of model performance.

6. **Conclusion:**
    - Summary of findings.
    - Reflection on the effectiveness of different models.
    - Recommendations based on the analysis.

## Instructions
To execute the notebook, follow these steps:

1. **Setup Environment:**
    - Ensure you have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed.
    - Install necessary libraries using the following commands:
     ```bash
          pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
     ```

2. **Download Dataset:**
    - Ensure the `kl.csv` dataset is available in the same directory as the notebook.

3. **Running the Notebook:**
    - Open the Jupyter Notebook and navigate to the Project.ipynb file.
    - Run all cells sequentially to see the complete workflow and results.
